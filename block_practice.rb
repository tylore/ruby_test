#Understood that this is a total cop out, spent a a ton of time googling the specific command and along the way learned a ton
# about what the Enumerable class actually is. I didn't even know what a module was on this mornings quiz.



# **TODO ENTER CODE **
# * create a class called Persons that hand rolls an 'each' iterator method, inside of which you
#   define some names, the each method will allow you to iterate over these
#   This means that the class you create...say Person... will respond to Person.each.
# * use a normal each loop to iterate over the class and output the names to the console.

Class Persons

  for n Persons.length |do|
    n = @name


  end






# **TODO ENTER CODE**
# * Find a name starting with 'a', you will need to include the Enumerable module into Persons, make sure you have a name
#   starting with 'a'






# **TODO ENTER CODE**
# * Check if 'bob' is included in your names





# **TODO ENTER CODE**
#Search for if there is one name that has a space in it









# **TODO ENTER CODE**
# * Create an array of numbers 1-10
# * Search an array to find all matches for numbers greater than 5










# **TODO ENTER CODE**
# * Do the opposite as above, using the exact same block, but a different method, return all numbers that are less
#   than 5










# **TODO ENTER CODE**
# * Create an array of colors: red, orange, yellow,green,violet,indigo
# * Using a regex search the array to see which entries contain 'o'
